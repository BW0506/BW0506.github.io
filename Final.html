      <h2>Technical Write Up</h2>
      <p>This system requires high currents! So it is important for us to make sure our system has enough current ouput for motors and other hardwares. So I used a 6*AA battery pack to power the L298N motor driver. The 5V output of the L298N supplies power to the Arduino and other components. The L298N motor driver controls the two TT motors, enabling forward and backward movement. The car has two TT motors positioned at the back, which enable turning by adjusting their movement independently. Also, two ultrasonic sensors are connected to the Arduino. These sensors detect obstacles by measuring distance, and the car adjusts its direction accordingly. To make Beep Beep turn right, I set the left wheel move forward and the right wheel move backward. To make it turn left, I set the left wheel move backward and right wheel move forward. There are a lot of thing to play around with Beep Beep. For example, we could add a voice reponse for Beep Beep by using DFPlayer. DFPlayer requires a TF card with mp3 files and a speaker as well. In this way, we can make Beep Beep to say anything we want. Further more, we can develop Beep Beep to a smart robot cleaner by using an extra servo motor and corresponding mechanic structures, this way allows Beep Beep to make a pick up movement. I will try to make these improvements in future!</p>
