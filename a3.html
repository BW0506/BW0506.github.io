      <h2>Schematic:</h2>
      <img src="Schematic3.jpg" />
      <p>This is the schematic for my 3 LEDs and 1 photoresistor connected to the Arduino, and the calculation for each resistance.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Circuit:</h2>
      <img src="Circuit3.png" />
      <p>Here is my circuit, as the calculation showed above we can see that the resistance for red LED is 160 ohms and for blue LED is 85 ohms, so I picked two 220 ohms resistors, one 100 ohms resistor and one 5k1 resistor for the voltage divider. </p>

      <pre><code>
        int SENSOR = A0;    // create an variable name for pin A0 called SENSOR
        int RED_LED = 10;   // create an variable name for pin 10 called RED_LED
        int BLUE_LED = 5;   // create an variable name for pin 5 called BLUE_LED
        
        void setup() {
          pinMode(RED_LED, OUTPUT);   // initialize digital pin RED_LED as an output.
          pinMode(BLUE_LED, OUTPUT);  // initialize digital pin BLUE_LED as an output.
          Serial.begin(9600);         // Sets the data rate in 9600 bits per second
        }
        
        void loop() {
          int SENSORval = analogRead(SENSOR);             // read the state of the sensor value
          // set the value range according to the serial monitor, 
          // map the sensor value with LED brightness.
          SENSORval = map(SENSORval, 300, 900, 0, 255); 
          if (SENSORval > 0) {                            // Set the condition as the sensor value changes,
            analogWrite(RED_LED, SENSORval);              // the brightness of the LED also changes
            analogWrite(BLUE_LED, SENSORval);
          } else {
            digitalWrite(BLUE_LED, LOW);
            digitalWrite(RED_LED, LOW);
          }
          Serial.println(SENSORval);                      // print the sensor results to the serial monitor

      <h2>Input Output!</h2>

      <p>This is my final result, as the sensor value changes, the brightness of the LED also changes.</p>

      <h2>Questions:</h2>
      <p>In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.</p>
      <img src="Graph4.jpg" />
      <p>I think the variable resistor can be either R1 or R2, but the output voltage is different.</p>
      <p>Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</p>
      <img src="Graph3.jpg" />
      <p>AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.</p>
      <p>I think the value that takes into the map() code should be different. If the analogWrite converted to 10-bit PWM, the range is 0-1024. If the analogWrite converted to 16-bit PWM, the range is 0-65536.</p>
